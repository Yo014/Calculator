 1.ButtonPane:

  -  Contains the buttons and their layout.
  -  Handles event-driven actions for number and operator buttons.
  -  Updates the display (TextField) based on user interaction.
  -  Performs calculations using the calculate method, which determines the result based on the operator.
    
 2.CalculatorApp:

  -  The main entry point of the application.
  -  Sets up the JavaFX Stage and Scene.
  -  Integrates the ButtonPane and display field into the application window.
